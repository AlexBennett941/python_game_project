# python_game_project
Collaborative project to create a game within python.
This project was awesome to work on. It taught me some valuable lessons on working with others in a programming environment. Working with others and collaborating on how we should execute the project was a lot of fun. Anything with #alex is what I was responsible for. I also did a lot of work in the main function.
